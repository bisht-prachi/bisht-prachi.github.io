Proposed and analyzed a Vicsek-type rule-based model for self-propelled particles with antiparallel alignment interactions. Despite purely repulsive dynamics, the system self-organizes into interwoven hexagonal lattices and counter-propagating lanes in the steady state. The study uncovers how noise and density modulate transitions between super-diffusive, ballistic, and diffusive regimes of motion, revealing conditions for spontaneous laning and crystallization.

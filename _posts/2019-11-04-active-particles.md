Developed a statistical-physics model to study interface growth driven by a single active particle, capturing protein-induced deformation and motility in biological membranes. The work offers insight into active matter dynamics and cell membrane processes, bridging non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and biophysics. Published as: **P. Bisht & M.

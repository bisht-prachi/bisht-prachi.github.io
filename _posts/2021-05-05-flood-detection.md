Developed a flood segmentation model using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B0 encoder, trained on Sentinel-1 SAR imagery for the NASA ETCI 2021 GRSS Flood Detection Challenge. It achieved an IoU score of 0.6 — not a top-three finish, but a great hands-on experience in working with SAR data and deep learning for flood mapping. I’m now exploring how to adapt this for real-time, on-orbit edge inferencing on ASIC hardware-a step closer to smarter, autonomous satellites!

Developed a flood segmentation model using U-Net with an EfficientNet-B0 encoder trained on Sentinel-1 SAR imagery for the NASA ETCI 2021 GRSS Flood Detection Challenge, achieving an IoU score of 0.6. Although I did not land in the top 3, this project provided valuable experience in handling SAR data and applying deep learning techniques for flood detection.

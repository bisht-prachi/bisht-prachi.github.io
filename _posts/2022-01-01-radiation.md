Developed a first-principles physical model to quantify performance degradation in space-grade solar cells under electron irradiation. The model captures the evolution of minority carrier diffusion length as a function of radiation fluence, enabling accurate end-of-life performance prediction. **Published as a single-author paper in *Journal of Applied Physics* (2022).**

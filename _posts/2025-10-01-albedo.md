Developed ensembled tree-based machine learning models to predict the impact of Earth’s albedo on solar cell performance aboard low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites. The model achieved a 30% reduction in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for on-orbit solar current prediction across multiple spacecraft platforms. Results are part of a forthcoming publication in *Advances in Space Research*.
